# Become a Skeptic
    
Mark it: **for every new idea, there are existing thoughts and facts**. We humans tend to believe too much, and these beliefs are so deeply rooted in our brains that we have stopped being neutral. As an engineer, I've observed this issue in nearly every engineer I encounter. It’s more common than not, and finding genuinely good engineers is rare. The few exceptional ones stand out because of their cognitive approach to their thoughts. This document explores what makes them different and how they develop such a cognitive approach.

I divide people into a three-band spectrum:

1. **Believers**: These individuals are completely biased. They don't tend to think much and sometimes, even after realizing they are wrong, they still strongly stick to their beliefs and defend them. While I believe there is no absolute right or wrong—since it depends on the person, situation, and external factors like profit or loss—something can be considered wrong if you recognize it as such after the fact. Your mind tells you not to repeat it. Each person has their own mind, existence, and thoughts, so right or wrong is entirely personal.

2. **Skeptics**: People in this spectrum are more mature with their ideas. They don't believe anything until they find evidence. Most scientists fall into this category; they are often called skeptics. If an idea is presented to them, they start questioning it right away. There is no chance a skeptic will just believe what you say unless the fact interests them. Even then, if it does not align with their interests, they might ignore it. Becoming a skeptic is challenging because we are made up of thoughts instilled in us from early childhood, and questioning them feels like questioning our own existence.

3. **Denialists**: These are the people who question but don't stand up for their ideas. They keep their thoughts to themselves, fearing it would be heretical to speak against the majority of believers. They coexist more with believers than skeptics but are always supportive of whichever side they align with. They need a little push to change their side and strengthen their thoughts. A well-informed skeptic with abundant facts can easily sway them. Denialists don’t lie; they just ignore the truth because they have chosen a side and feel the need to stick with it.

A good engineer should be inclined towards skepticism; otherwise, they won't find good answers. Doubting yourself is also a crucial step towards becoming a skeptic.

## Developing a Skeptical Mindset

To foster a skeptical mindset, it is essential to question everything, even the ideas we hold dear. This involves:

1. **Critical Thinking**: Continuously analyzing and evaluating information rather than accepting it at face value.
   
2. **Curiosity**: Maintaining a natural curiosity and desire to understand how things work. This drives the pursuit of knowledge and the questioning of existing norms.

3. **Openness to Change**: Being open to changing your mind when presented with new evidence, even if it challenges long-held beliefs.

4. **Continuous Learning**: Engaging in lifelong learning to keep up with new information and perspectives.

5. **Healthy Doubt**: Practicing healthy doubt, not just towards external information but also towards one’s own ideas and assumptions.

By cultivating these traits, individuals can move towards a more skeptical and analytical mindset, which is invaluable in engineering and beyond. 

## Conclusion

Becoming Skeptic means questioning our deeply held beliefs and approaching every idea with a fresh perspective. By understanding where we fall on the spectrum of believers, skeptics, and denialists, we can work towards becoming more effective thinkers and problem solvers. In engineering, as in life, skepticism is not just a trait but a necessity for innovation and progress.
