# Context for General JavaScript Function

Idea is to develop a method to provide arguments to multiple level down to a function without doing prop drilling. It is done in react via context API. But I want it to be for general programming.

## Introduction

I write a lot of code every day. I have made thousands of functions and classes. I am both a functional and OO engineer. But for function programming, I struggle with passing down parameters to function at a deep level. In general, I prevent doing it, but in some cases it becomes mandatory. I've seen the react solving this problem using context. But I want this to be happening in general javascript and typescript. And I also want to make it a general practice b/w programmer. Making sure it is always typesafe and error free. But first, I just want to make it work.

## Problem

I have a function that is deep down in the call stack. I want to pass some parameters to it. I can't pass it from the top level. I want to pass it from the middle of the call stack.

## Solution

Yet to be developed. (If you have any idea, please let me know.)
