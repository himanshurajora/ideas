# A new religion (NeoMan)

I have been thinking about creation of a new religion. A religion that will show the path to future generations. Rather than having a god, it is a completely atheist ideology. It is completely supported by logic and science where everything illogical or unknown is put into the category of "Yet to be known". Yes, that's how simple it is. If we don't know something, we don't make up stories about it. We just say, "We don't know yet". And we write it down in the "Yet to be known" category to be researched in the future.

I've been thinking about different names as well. Few of them I generated using AI tools, some of them I came up with myself. Here are a few of them:

- NeoSanatan
- Zism
- NeoMan

Each of them is great, but I finally chose the NeoMan. Where Neo represents "New" and Man stands for Man/Human. Ultimately representing ideas for a next gen human race.

Core Ideas So far:

I have thought of multiple ideologies but I finally came up with something Atheist. Now it may sound that how can some religion be "Atheist". So, it must be certain that I am not upto some kind of religion but for a ideology instead. Something that a group of people can take a base and think upon.

I don't have anyone joined this idea yet but I have talked to some people about it and most of them like it (Note: That most of those most just take it as a joke and support this as a joke only).

So here are the ideas:

- Atheism
- Logic and Science
- Giving the rule making power to community
- Inspiring people for coming up with new ideas
- Studying all the existing religions, removing the god element, and then pro-found my ideology using their good ideas.

I hope, I may be able to come up with new things in the future. But for now that's it.

Thanks for reading.
