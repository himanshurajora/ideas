# Think From Scratch

Mark it `for every new idea there are existing thoughts and facts`. We humans tend to believe too much, it's that at that deep rooted into our brains that we have stopped being neutral. I am into engineering and I found that same issue with almost every second engineer that I meet, I say every single it it is certainly more than that, in fact I rarely find good engineers, I know some of them personally those are good and they really stand out from others. You can clearly see people some people or group and expect them to make good and unbiased decisions than to others. What makes them different, how did they develop such cognitive approach with their thoughts; this is the core of this document.

I divide people in a 3 band spectrum:

1. **Believers**: These are completely biased once, they don't tend to think much and sometimes even after realizing that they are wrong, they still strongly stick with them and defend even the wrong once that they realized that is wrong. Although in my thought process there is nothing right or wrong, it completely depends on the person, situation, and external factors such as profit or loss related to the deed. But still wrong can be called something that you think is wrong after you've done it. Your mind says don't do it again. Each person has his own mind, existence and thoughts hence right or wrong is completely personal.

2. **Skeptics**: People in this spectrum are much mature with their ideas, they just don't believe anything util they find evidence. Most scientists fall into this category. In fact scientists are usually called Skeptics. If an idea is presented to them; they will start questioning right away. There is no chance a skeptic person will just believe in what you said until the fact is not of his interest. And that thing certainly is the one that he will ignore. Although becoming a skeptic person is not an easy task to do because we all are made up from thoughts that are given to us from our early childhood and questioning them is like questioning your own existence.

3. **Denialist**: According to me these are the people who question but don't stand out for their ideas. They tend to keep their thoughts just thought and don't speak for them because they think it will be heretic to speak against the majority of believers. Yes, they co-exists more with believers than to skeptics. But both ways they are always supportive to whichever side they are with. They just need a little push to change their side and strengthen their thoughts. A good skeptic that have abundant facts to prove his point can easily take them to his side. Denialists don't lie they just ignore the truth because they have chosen a side and they have to stick with it.

A good engineer is should simply be inclined towards skepticism otherwise we he won't find good answers. Doubting yourself is also an crucial step towards becoming a skeptic.
